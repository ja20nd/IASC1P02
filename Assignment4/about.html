<p id="abouttext">
My name is Joel Antony. I am a fourth-year business administration/marketing student with a passion
for the film industry. On this site, I write and curate my film reviews. I also
have a passion for photography and film-making. I have always been interested in
all aspects of film-making and I hope to be able to work on the production of a
film or television show one day. The two aspects that speak to me the most is
both directing and cinematography. I have always admired a director's ability
to express and control their creative vision and manage such a large team of
people to execute that vision. Similarly, I admire the technical skill required
to be a cinematographer and I am fascinated by how the greatest
cinematographers have such an in-depth understanding of their equipment, their
subject and their environment. My favouite directors include Martin Scorcese,
Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino.</p>
