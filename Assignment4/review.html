	<h2>Wind River</h2>
<h3>Review by Joel Antony</h3>
</div>


<div class="wrapper">
<p id="reviewessay">
	Taylor Sheridan's film "Wind River" (2017) recounts the story of a wildlife
	officer with a terrible history who pairs up with an FBI agent to investigate
	a murder in the frozen reserve of Wind River in an attempt to make amends for
	his previous failures.
	<br>
	<br>
	Jeremy Renner portrays Cory Lambert, a US Fish and Wildlife Service tracker
	on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, in what is possibly his
	greatest (and definitely most complex) performance to date.
	The appearance of Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a rookie FBI agent summoned
	by the Tribal Police, puts Lambert's hunting skills to the test.
	Banner who is extremely unprepared for the frosty wilderness of this remote
	reserve, immediately realizes that Lambert is her key to breaking the case,
	since he has a much better knowledge of the geography as well as the
	relationships among Wind River's indigenous population. Lambert, on the other
	hand, is considerably more concerned with exacting “wilderness” justice than
	with complying with federal law.
	<br>
	<br>
	Wind River is a chilling film in more ways than one, with writer-director
	Taylor Sheridan combining suspense with social criticism in a narrative about
	individuals who have been left behind emotionally and financially. This film’s
	message regarding the living and policing conditions of the indigenous people
	in these remote reserves is perfectly conveyed through a bone-chilling and
	suspenseful tale. This film, engages the audience from the start and leaves
	them with something to contemplate afterwards.
	<br>
	<br>
	The mystery here grows by the minute, propelled by outstanding screen
	chemistry between Renner, Olsen who are well known for their roles together
	in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is
	fantastic. The sound design makes excellent use of the loud silence of the icy
	winds of this remote land. There are plenty of moments in this film where the
	use of silence is very powerful in conveying the vast emptyness of Wind River.
	Additionally, there's plenty of action in this film too, but the film's
	investigation of race, gender, and sorrow is just as enthralling as any
	stand-off. Speaking of which, the film's final stand-off will have you
	holding your breath and feeling the shivers and chills of the freezing terrain
	of Wind River. 8.5/10.
